Looking for a prose description of me? Here you'll find two versions of my conference bio, so you can pick whichever you think is most (in)appropriate.

## Less Formal

Brendan O'Connor is a security engineer, researcher, and consultant based in Seattle. Once described by a former coworker as "not the lawyer we need, but the lawyer we deserve" (which apparently wasn't meant as a compliment), he works to get a handle on how people are messing with the Internet (and how we can ask them nicely to knock it off), builds security programs, argues with people who are wrong on the Internet about security governance, and runs the Narwhal project/conference (<https://narwhal.be>). He lives in Seattle, WA surrounded by radio gear and cat hair.
