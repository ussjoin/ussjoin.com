Looking for a prose description of me? Here you'll find the bio I use for security conferences, and the bio I use for legal conferences.

<h2>Security Conferences</h2>

Described by coworkers as "not the lawyer we need, but the lawyer we deserve" (and he's pretty sure that wasn't meant as a compliment), is a security researcher, consultant, and attorney based in Seattle. While he is a lawyer, he is not your lawyer. His day job is building security programs, but at night, he transforms into a person who spends too much time arguing with people who are wrong on the Internet. If caught, his companies will deny all knowledge of this presentation. He also runs the Narwhal project/conference (https://narwhal.be).

<h2>Legal Conferences</h2>

Brendan Oâ€™Connor is a security researcher and consultant based in Seattle, WA, where his work focuses on assisting corporations and law firms with security, risk management, and information governance needs. He spent four terms as Vice-Chair of the ABA's Information Security Committee. His research focuses on distributed sensing and disposable computing, and through his consultancy, Malice Afterthought, he was awarded two DARPA Cyber Fast Track research contracts. His work has been featured by Forbes, the New York Times, and Bloomberg TV, among many other media outlets. He has presented at computer security conferences in the United States and abroad, including the Black Hat USA and Europe conferences, DEF CON, Paranoia, ShmooCon, RSA, and ThotCon. He holds the degrees of Bachelor and Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Science from The Johns Hopkins University, and Juris Doctor (with honors) from the University of Wisconsin Law School; he is admitted to the bar in Montana and Washington.
