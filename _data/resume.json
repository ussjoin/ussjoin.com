Sick of the hostile relationship between security and development, security and operations, security and HR, and/or security and everyone not wearing a black t-shirt? There’s a better way. Faced with the challenge of building a security function into a society that wasn’t sure it wanted one (but which nonetheless needed it), Charles Rowan and Richard Mayne set out what became known as the Peelian Principles of Policing, or Policing by Consent. They provide an effective model for running a security group that stands with its organization, rather than against it. We are, after all, 'only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the intent of the community welfare.' Join us to become a security Bobby—where a commitment to service is non-optional, but the silly hat’s only needed if you like it.",

Endrun, by contrast, takes NASA's Disruption-Tolerant Networking project from a laboratory experiment to a functional system that supports user-friendly encryption in hostile environments.

     "abstract": "Gamification, and online gambling, are among the booming global phenomena of the past decade. Given the highly polarised reactions to gambling across different jurisdictions, yet the boost it can provide to governmental coffers in these trying economic times, few are surprised that online gambling has generated both political controversy and a plethora of cross-border regulatory and legal issues. This session initially explores these critical issues through the eyes of major online gambling companies. The second segment will be interactive and include a debate between an online gaming hacker and a representative of a gaming / gambling company.",

     "abstract": "F-BOMB is a disposable computing project, and Reticle is its software brain: a distributed, leaderless system for transferring data and commands to and from the tiny, distributed, dirt-cheap little boxes. Together, these two systems form a botnet-styled sensor network that can be deployed the same way as a smoke grenade by a field agent, but with intelligent encryption, plausible deniability, and a peer-to-peer command network to ensure that an enemy can't compromise your goals-- whether you're providing Internet access to an Occupy group, or playing distributed hide and seek for cell phones. We discuss the design and implementation of Reticle, which was intended to take some of the networking ideas from modern botnets and apply them in a more useful context. Reticle was created with support from DARPA Cyber Fast Track, and the code, utilities, and documentation created under that project will be released with the talk.",

     "abstract": "Recent bills such as ACTA, COICA, and SOPA in legislatures worldwide demonstrate that there exists a fundamental disconnect between hackers and politicians. Worse, the people charged with dealing with law on the ground, the lawyers, rarely have any significant technical background obtained within the last few decades. This must change. It's all well and good to write your congressperson or donate to the EFF, but it's not enough; we need hackers to go to law school. Lawyers-- whether they work as attorneys, or bring their knowledge of the law back to other fields-- are uniquely situated to effect direct change on politics, social issues, and the law on the ground (where they arrest poor hackers), and unlike many fields, it's not enough to be self-taught. This presentation will focus on the utility of the hacking ethos within the law, as well as the 'law school experience,' technical bits about actually getting in, and how to keep yourself from going nuts while spending three years surrounded by those who can't tell their megabytes from their overbites (and are terrified by Wireshark, let alone the more subtle tools in existence). Expect stories, humorous anecdotes, and terrifying lapses in judgment.",

     "abstract": "Projects such as the incredible Wireless Aerial Surveillance Platform give you the ability to monitor or attack networks far from accessible areas, but are limited by their deployment characteristics: $6000+ buys you just 10-30 minutes on target, and you have simultaneously to do your work and defend the physical plane from Bad Men With Projectile Weapons, lest they take exception to your plans. Disposable computing designed for just one use can provide massive reductions in cost and time to deployment without sacrificing flexibility; we show how $50-$75 can give you upwards of 24 hours to work on a task, while using only off-the-shelf hardware, and leaving no data onsite for an adversary to analyze after the operation. These computers can then be planted manually, or even dropped from unspecialized UAVs (such as the Parrot Drone) to allow your expensive plane to return to safety while you do your work.",

     "abstract": "Reputation forms an important part of how we come to trust people in face-to-face interactions, and thus situations involving trust online have come to realize that reputation is an important characteristic in the digital age. We propose a new holistic and context-free approach to quantifying reputation on the Internet, based upon a stock exchange where users can trade reputation shares of other users and obtain goodwill dividends, including new algorithms for identifying and creating digital identities not inherently tied to a user’s personally identifiable information. We developed such a system, named Mnikr, and deployed our system on the Internet for a month to demonstrate and evaluate this approach. Our results suggest that existing public data sources can indeed be used to create an overarching social network whose utility is greater than its number of users would indicate, and in which reputation measurements are generated that are actually indicative of each user’s standing in society.",
