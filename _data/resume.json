This isn't an impasse---it's an opportunity for you to promote DevOps best practices throughout your company, using the extremely effective carrot of 'this is how we can sell more!' We'll cover what a SOC 2 audit is, what you get to decide when getting one, and the happy path for cloudy companies to pass audits using modern DevOps practices. The tools you already use provide a robust compliance framework; it just requires you to tell the story to the auditors. You'll also get with a useful list of things to start asking other teams (like IT and HR) to handle, and a cheat sheet for translating DevOps to Auditor. In 25 minutes, you'll have the knowledge you need to prepare for a SOC (or many other kinds of compliance) audit, and be ready to sell your team's hard work to an auditor (even if they ask you where your tape library is).",

Sick of the hostile relationship between security and development, security and operations, security and HR, and/or security and everyone not wearing a black t-shirt? There’s a better way. Faced with the challenge of building a security function into a society that wasn’t sure it wanted one (but which nonetheless needed it), Charles Rowan and Richard Mayne set out what became known as the Peelian Principles of Policing, or Policing by Consent. They provide an effective model for running a security group that stands with its organization, rather than against it. We are, after all, 'only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the intent of the community welfare.' Join us to become a security Bobby—where a commitment to service is non-optional, but the silly hat’s only needed if you like it.",

The discussion will be helpful to lawyers across the spectrum who deal with both compliance (reviewing policies and procedures) and litigation.  First, we will discuss the much-anticipated decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, concerning Article III standing requirements and consumer privacy claims.  Next, we will discuss the ongoing fight between Apple and the FBI over the use of strong encryption.  One case, currently pending before a federal magistrate judge in California, will be heard later his month.  Please join us to learn more.",

It's all well and good to write your congressperson or donate to the EFF, but it's not enough; we need hackers to go to law school. Lawyers-- whether they work as attorneys, or bring their knowledge of the law back to other fields-- are uniquely situated to effect direct change on politics, social issues, and the law on the ground (where they arrest poor hackers), and unlike many fields, it's not enough to be self-taught. This presentation will focus on the utility of the hacking ethos within the law, as well as the 'law school experience,' technical bits about actually getting in, and how to keep yourself from going nuts while spending three years surrounded by those who can't tell their megabytes from their overbites (and are terrified by Wireshark, let alone the more subtle tools in existence).

            "abstract": "Reputation forms an important part of how we come to trust people in face-to-face interactions, and thus situations involving trust online have come to realize that reputation is an important characteristic in the digital age. We propose a new holistic and context-free approach to quantifying reputation on the Internet, based upon a stock exchange where users can trade reputation shares of other users and obtain goodwill dividends, including new algorithms for identifying and creating digital identities not inherently tied to a user’s personally identifiable information. We developed such a system, named Mnikr, and deployed our system on the Internet for a month to demonstrate and evaluate this approach. Our results suggest that existing public data sources can indeed be used to create an overarching social network whose utility is greater than its number of users would indicate, and in which reputation measurements are generated that are actually indicative of each user’s standing in society.",
