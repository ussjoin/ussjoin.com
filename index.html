<div class="hello">
    <p>My <a href="cv.html">CV</a> (and shorter <a href="resume.html">resume</a>) have details about some things I've done, if you're curious.<p>
    <p>I also:
        <ul>
            <li>Muck about with <a href="https://k3qb.radio">amateur radio</a>, and am president of a <a href="https://nars.narwhal.be">rather unorthodox ham radio club</a> as well.</li>
            <li>Consult, via my company, <a href="mailto:brendan@maliceafterthought.com">Malice Afterthought</a>.</li>
            <li>Run an occasional <a href="https://narwhal.be">conference</a> on intersectional information security.</li>
            <li>Drive a <a href="https://shady.is">deeply concerning van</a>.</li>
            <li>Occasionally post on <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@ussjoin">Cloud Island</a>, part of the Fediverse.</li>
            <li>Blog (very occasionally) at <a href="https://blog.ussjoin.com">Times and Measures</a>.</li>
            <li>Spend time convincing wood to serve various purposes.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>If you'd like to contact me, email is usually the best way; <a href="mailto:bfo@ussjoin.com">bfo@ussjoin.com</a> works well.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Sometimes, I have needed a conference bio for reasons. Here's one for me:</p>
    <p>Brendan O'Connor is a security engineer, researcher, and consultant based in Seattle. Once described by a former coworker as "not the lawyer we need, but the lawyer we deserve" (which apparently wasn't meant as a compliment), he works to get a handle on how people are messing with the Internet (and how we can ask them nicely to knock it off), builds security programs, occasionally argues with people who are wrong on the Internet about security governance, and runs the <a href="https://narwhal.be">Narwhal project/conference</a>. He lives in Seattle, WA surrounded by radio gear and cat hair.</p>
